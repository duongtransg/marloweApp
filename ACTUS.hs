| IPANX | CycleAnchorDateOfInterestPayment  |   Date from which the periodic occurring dates are calculated through the cycle length. The first IP event (first interest cash flow will be paid) takes place on this anchor. If IPANX is not set, then there will be exactly one interest cash flow at MaturityDate.
                                            |   Note: Interest accrual calculation starts always at IED (or PRD if set).
| IPCL  | CycleOfInterestPayment            |   For the explanation of the format see RRCL. The interval will be adjusted yet by EOMC and BDC.
                                                The lower boundary of accrual calculation is IED and the upper boundary MD where also a last interest cash flow happens. In case where the Cycle_Of_IP does not coincide with the Maturity_Date, the last interest cash flow will be time adjusted depending on the stub information.

PYTP PenaltyType Defines whether prepayment is linked to a penalty and of which kind.

    = State Variables

    = Contract Events

    A contract event e refers to any contractually scheduled or un-scheduled event at
a certain time t and of a certain type k.

    = State Transition Functions.

State Transition Functions (STF) define how the State Variables are being updated when a certain Contract Event e(k, t) applies from a pre-event (i.e. pre-time t) state indexed t− to a post-event (i.e. post-time t) state indexed t+.
The STF for an IP event and PAM contract is written as STF_IP_PAM() and maps e.g. state variable Nominal Accrued from a pre-event state Nact− to post-event state Nact+.

    = Contract Lifetime.

The lifetime of a contract starts with its SD and ends with
min(MD, AMD, PR∗, STD, TD, tmax).
